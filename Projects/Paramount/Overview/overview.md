# About Paramount

Paramount is a mass media and entertainment company operating a variety of channels worldwide.

## Value proposition

Paramount primarily uses their system to monitor distribution/channel feeds coming out of their London (LMC) and New York (CCC) locations. This is achieved through running a variety of elements (Stored in the "Paramounts GLOBAL > Elements" view ) representing each of the devices they're currently using. Each of these devies are then connected within SLA Services for either the London branch (Stored in the "Paramounts GLOBAL > ATS" view) or the New York Branch (Stored in the "Paramounts GLOBAL > CCC" view). Each SLA service has the elements within them are filtered to just have the parameters and display keys needed to specific the distribution/channel feed its monitoring.
<!--
A value proposition should clearly articulate the benefits and solutions the project brings to its users or stakeholders.
It should emphasize how the delivered system addresses specific challenges, such as improving workflow efficiency, 
enhancing content delivery, ensuring reliability, or enabling the implementation of novel services.

The value proposition should highlight innovative features like automation, integration with existing
broadcasting tools, or scalability to meet industry demands. It's important to communicate measurable outcomes,
such as time savings, cost reductions, or quality improvements directly impacting broadcasting professionals and their operations.

## Delivered value

* **Channel Monitoring:** Each of their devices contain information for multiple distribution/channel feeds which aren't easy to see for a single distribution under a single page. Through the use of services, they're able to filter to the specific parameters that match the specific channel they want to monitor and have it all in one page. They also have used visios that show the connection path for each distribution and how each part of that connection's current alarm state is. 
* **Quick Monitoring Feedback :** This is achieved on the London implementation through the utilization of text to speech to audibly declare any alarm as they come in. On the New York implementation, they utilize email alerts which are sent when errors are discovered for on-air devices.
