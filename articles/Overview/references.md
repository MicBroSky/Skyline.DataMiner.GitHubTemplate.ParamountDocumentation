## Internal documentation
During the deployment phase, we developed comprehensive documentation that captures the insights gained from discussions
with the sales team and later with the customer during the various stages of the project delivery.

All of these valuable documents are accessible in our internal project folder. The most pertinent information can be found
in the following folders:

| Folder                                                                                  | Content                                                                             |
