## Value proposition
A value proposition should clearly articulate the benefits and solutions the project brings to its users or stakeholders.
It should emphasize how the delivered system addresses specific challenges, such as improving workflow efficiency, 
enhancing content delivery, ensuring reliability, or enabling the implementation of novel services.

The value proposition should highlight innovative features like automation, integration with existing
broadcasting tools, or scalability to meet industry demands. It's important to communicate measurable outcomes,
such as time savings, cost reductions, or quality improvements directly impacting broadcasting professionals and their operations.
