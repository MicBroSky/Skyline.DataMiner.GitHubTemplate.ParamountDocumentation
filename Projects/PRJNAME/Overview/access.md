> * Open a web browser and navigate to the <CUSTOMER> [VPN Portal](https://<CUSTOMER_VPN_PORTAL>).
> * Login using the valid VPN credentials available on [Skyline Password Manager](https://passwords.skyline.be/).
> * Select one of the user that can authenticate your connection using the <2FA_AUTHENTICATOR> and select the preferable 
> authentication method(send me a push or enter a password).
> * After successful authentication it should start downloading <VPN_CLIENT> and install it in your PC, if you don't have it yet.
> * The <VPN_CLIENT> should now indicate that you are connected as following:
